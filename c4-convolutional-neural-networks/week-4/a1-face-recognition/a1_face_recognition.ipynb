    "# Face Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! In this assignment, you're going to build a face recognition system. Many of the ideas presented here are from [FaceNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf). In the lecture, you also encountered [DeepFace](https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/deepface-closing-the-gap-to-human-level-performance-in-face-verification.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Face recognition problems commonly fall into one of two categories: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Face Verification** \"Is this the claimed person?\" For example, at some airports, you can pass through customs by letting a system scan your passport and then verifying that you (the person carrying the passport) are the correct person. A mobile phone that unlocks using your face is also using face verification. This is a 1:1 matching problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Face Recognition** \"Who is this person?\" For example, the video lecture showed a [face recognition video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr4rx0Spihs) of Baidu employees entering the office without needing to otherwise identify themselves. This is a 1:K matching problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "FaceNet learns a neural network that encodes a face image into a vector of 128 numbers. By comparing two such vectors, you can then determine if two pictures are of the same person.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this assignment, you'll be able to: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Differentiate between face recognition and face verification\n",
    "* Implement one-shot learning to solve a face recognition problem\n",
    "* Apply the triplet loss function to learn a network's parameters in the context of face recognition\n",
    "* Explain how to pose face recognition as a binary classification problem\n",
    "* Map face images into 128-dimensional encodings using a pretrained model\n",
    "* Perform face verification and face recognition with these encodings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Channels-last notation**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you'll be using a pre-trained model which represents ConvNet activations using a \"channels last\" convention, as used during the lecture and in previous programming assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a batch of images will be of shape $(m, n_H, n_W, n_C)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Note on Submission to the AutoGrader\n",
    "\n",
    "Before submitting your assignment to the AutoGrader, please make sure you are not doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have not added any _extra_ `print` statement(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "2. You have not added any _extra_ code cell(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "3. You have not changed any of the function parameters.\n",
    "4. You are not using any global variables inside your graded exercises. Unless specifically instructed to do so, please refrain from it and use the local variables instead.\n",
    "5. You are not changing the assignment code where it is not required, like creating _extra_ variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do any of the following, you will get something like, `Grader Error: Grader feedback not found` (or similarly unexpected) error upon submitting your assignment. Before asking for help/debugging the errors in your assignment, check for these first. If this is the case, and you don't remember the changes you have made, you can get a fresh copy of the assignment by following these [instructions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks/supplement/DS4yP/h-ow-to-refresh-your-workspace)."
